Description: IsoCorrectoRGUI is a Graphical User Interface for the IsoCorrectoR package. IsoCorrectoR performs the correction of mass spectrometry data from stable isotope labeling/tracing metabolomics experiments with regard to natural isotope abundance and tracer impurity. Data from both MS and MS/MS measurements can be corrected (with any tracer isotope: 13C, 15N, 18O...), as well as high resolution MS data from multiple-tracer experiments (e.g. 13C and 15N used simultaneously).
