For the IsoCorrectoR.bat batch file to start IsoCorrectoR by double-clicking on it, it is required that cmd.exe is the
standard program for opening batch files (batfile, .bat). This should usually be the case. If not however, this can be 
achieved with the following commands in admin command line:

assoc .bat=batfile 
ftype batfile=%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe %1
 
The assoc command defines that the .bat ending is associated with batch files (batfile).
The ftype command defines that batfiles should be opened using cmd.exe.
Windows 10 may ignore those commands at first. If so, resetting file associations to
standard in the system controls will help. This will however also reset all other associations that 
were set manually.
